## Task 1
Develop 10 unit tests for your code. Choose the functionality of interest you cover with your tests.
These tests will help you refactor your code: as you change your code and inevitably break your code
in unexpected ways, unit tests will help you notice those breaking parts and help you fix them.

## Task 2
- Choose two design patterns that you find useful for your project and implement them by refactoring your code.
- Choose a third design pattern. You donâ€™t have to implement it, only elaborate on how you would use it.

#### Singleton pattern
- Runner

#### Observer Pattern
- Runner, only move when state change from the solver

#### Factory Pattern
- Maze builder class, created tiles and Maze object

#### Strategy Pattern
- Different solvers
- Argument to specify canonical or factorized path
